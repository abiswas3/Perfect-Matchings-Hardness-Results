It is amazingly simple, expresses one of the most basic primitives in mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science (counting) and, for these reasons, is probably the most extensively studied combinatorial principle. In this survey we try to summarize what is known about its proof complexity, and what we would still like to prove.We also mention some applications of the pigeonhole principle to the study of efficient provability of major open problems in computational complexity, as well as some of its generalizations in the form of general matching principles.",

The number of constraints required by our algorithm matches (up to polylogarithmic factors) the best known bounds for efficient refutation of fully random instances. Our main technical contribution is an algorithm to strongly refute semi-random instances of the Boolean k-XOR problem on n variables that have \\textasciitilde {O}(nk/2) constraints. (In a semi-random k-XOR instance, the equations can be arbitrary and only the right hand sides are random.)One of our key insights is to identify a simple combinatorial property of random XOR instances that makes spectral refutation work. Our approach involves taking an instance that does not satisfy this property (i.e., is not pseudorandom) and reducing it to a partitioned collection of 2-XOR instances. We analyze these subinstances using a carefully chosen quadratic form as proxy, which in turn is bounded via a combination of spectral methods and semidefinite programming. The analysis of our spectral bounds relies only on an off-the-shelf matrix Bernstein inequality. Even for the purely random case, this leads to a shorter proof compared to the ones in the literature that rely on problem-specific trace-moment computations.",

  abstract      = "Let P:{0,1}k \rightarrow{} {0,1} be a nontrivial k-ary predicate. Consider a random instance of the constraint satisfaction problem (P) on n variables with \ensuremath{\Delta} n constraints, each being P applied to k randomly chosen literals. Provided the constraint density satisfies \ensuremath{\Delta} \gg{} 1, such an instance is unsatisfiable with high probability. The refutation problem is to efficiently find a proof of unsatisfiability. We show that whenever the predicate P supports a t-wise uniform probability distribution on its satisfying assignments, the sum of squares (SOS) algorithm of degree d = \ensuremath{\Theta}(n/\ensuremath{\Delta}2/(t-1) log\ensuremath{\Delta}) (which runs in time nO(d)) cannot refute a random instance of (P). In particular, the polynomial-time SOS algorithm requires \ensuremath{\Omega}(n(t+1)/2) constraints to refute random instances of CSP(P) when P supports a t-wise uniform distribution on its satisfying assignments. Together with recent work of Lee, Raghavendra, Steurer (2015), our result also implies that any polynomial-size semidefinite programming relaxation for refutation requires at least \ensuremath{\Omega}(n(t+1)/2) constraints. More generally, we consider the \ensuremath{\delta}-refutation problem, in which the goal is to certify that at most a (1 - \ensuremath{\delta})-fraction of constraints can be simultaneously satisfied. We show that if P is \ensuremath{\delta}-close to supporting a t-wise uniform distribution on satisfying assignments, then the degree-\ensuremath{\Theta}(n/\ensuremath{\Delta}2/(t - 1) log\ensuremath{\Delta}) SOS algorithm cannot (\ensuremath{\delta}+o(1))-refute a random instance of CSP(P). This is the first result to show a distinction between the degree SOS needs to solve the refutation problem and the degree it needs to solve the harder \ensuremath{\delta}-refutation problem. Our results (which also extend with no change to CSPs over larger alphabets) subsume all previously known lower bounds for semialgebraic refutation of random CSPs. For every constraint predicate P, they give a three-way hardness tradeoff between the density of constraints, the SOS degree (hence running time), and the strength of the refutation. By recent algorithmic results of Allen, O'Donnell, Witmer (2015) and Raghavendra, Rao, Schramm (2016), this full three-way tradeoff is tight, up to lower-order factors.",

  abstract      = "We show that if a system of degree-k polynomial constraints on n Boolean variables has a Sums-of-Squares (SOS) proof of unsatisfiability with at most s many monomials, then it also has one whose degree is of the order of the square root of n log s plus k. A similar statement holds for the more general Positivstellensatz (PS) proofs. This establishes size-degree trade-offs for SOS and PS that match their analogues for weaker proof systems such as Resolution, Polynomial Calculus, and the proof systems for the LP and SDP hierarchies of Lov\'{a}sz and Schrijver. As a corollary to this, and to the known degree lower bounds, we get optimal integrality gaps for exponential size SOS proofs for sparse random instances of the standard NP-hard constraint optimization problems. We also get exponential size SOS lower bounds for Tseitin and Knapsack formulas. The proof of our main result relies on a zero-gap duality theorem for pre-ordered vector spaces that admit an order unit, whose specialization to PS and SOS may be of independent interest.",
