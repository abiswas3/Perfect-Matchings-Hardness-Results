\begin{definition}[Dependency Graphs]
	
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Lov\`asz Local Lemma]\label{lemma:lll}Let $\Dist \in \DistSet{\bit^*}$ be a discrete probability distribution.
Let $E_1,...,E_n$ be a set of events, and assume that the following hold:

\begin{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
	
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Calculus Refutations]\label{def:poly-calc-refutations}
	
\end{definition}

\subsection{Graph Theory Preliminaries}

For a graph $\Graph$, we use $\Vertices{\Graph}$ and $\Edges{\Graph}$ to denote the vertices and edges of $\Graph$. 
For any $E' \subseteq \Edges{\Graph}$ and a vertex $v \in \Vertices{\Graph}$, we use $\Neighbourhood{E'}{v} = \{ u \in \Vertices{\Graph} : (u,v) \in E' \}$ to denote the neighbourhood of $v$ with respect to $E'$, and $\degree{E'}{v}$ to denote the number of vertices adjacent to $v$ via edges in $E'$.

\begin{definition}[Subgraph]\label{def:subgraph}
A graph $G'=(V', E')$ is a subgraph of another graph $G=(V, E)$ iff (1) $V'\subseteq V$, and (2) $E'\subseteq E$ and  $(v1, v2) \in E' \implies (v1, v2) \in V')$.
	
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Sub-divisions]\label{def:subdivisions}
Given a graph $H$ and a function $\sigma: \Edges{H} \rightarrow \Naturals$, the $\sigma$-subdivision $H$, denoted by $\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}$, is the graph obtained by replacing each edge in $\Edges{H}$ with a path of length $\sigma(e)$ joining the end points of $e$ (such that all these paths are mutually vertex disjoint, except at the end points).	
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Topological Minor]\label{def:topological-minor}
A graph $H$ is a topological minor of a graph $G$ if there exists a subdivision $\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}$ that is isomorphic to \emph{any} subgraph of $G$.	
\end{definition}

Next we define pseudorandom graphs or expander graphs. 
Throughout this document, it suffices to treat $d$ as a small constant.

\begin{definition}[$\EnDeeLambda$ pseudorandom graphs]\label{def:expander-graphs}
Let $G$ be a $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, and, let $\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2, \dots, \geq \lambda_n$ denote eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of $G$.
We say $G$ is an $\EnDeeLambda$-graph if $\ExpansionFactor{\Graph} \Def \underset{{\{2, \dots, n\}}}{\max}|\lambda_i| \leq \lambda$.
\end{definition}


\begin{lemma}[Expander Mixing Lemma]\label{lemma:expanders-mixing-lemma}
	
\end{lemma}


\section{Embedding Machinery}

The following definitions are adapted from \citep{nenadov2023routing} but were originally introduced by \citet{feldman1988wide} in their work about the theory of wide sense blocking networks.

\begin{definition}[$(p, q)$-non blocking bipartite graphs \citep{nenadov2023routing}]
Given $p,q \in \Naturals$ , we say that a bipartite graph $\Graph = (A \cup B, E)$ is $(p, q)$ \emph{non-blocking}, if there exists a family $\Family{S}$ of subsets of $E$, called the \emph{safe states}, such that the following holds:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\emptyset \in \Family{S}$
	\item If $E'' \subseteq E'$ and $E' \in \Family{S}$, \emph{then}, $E'' \in \Family{S}$.
	\item Given $E' \in \Family{S}$ such that $|E'| \leq p$, and \emph{any} $v \in A$ with $\degree{E'}{v} < q$, there exists $e = (v, w) \in E \setminus E'$  such that (i) $E' \cup \Set{e} \in \SafeStates $, and (ii) $w$ is not incident to any edge in $E'$ i.e. $\forall x \in A$ we have $(x,w) \notin E'$. 
\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}

{\caption{A test figure with its caption side by side}\label{fig:test}}
{\includegraphics{assets/non-blocking-networks.pdf}}
\end{figure}

Next, we re-state a lemma by \citep[Proposition 1]{feldman1988wide} which describes the properties bipartite graphs must satisfy to be non-blocking.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:condtions-for-non-block}
Fix $a, r, s \in \Naturals$. Let $\Graph = (A \cup B, E)$ be a bipartite graph.
If for every $X \subseteq A$ of size $1 \leq |X| \leq 2a$, there are \emph{at least} $(r + s)|X|$ vertices in $B$ that are adjacent to $A$, \emph{then}, $\Graph$ is $(r, as)$-non blocking.
\end{lemma}


\section{Proof Of Main Result}

Let $G=(V,E)$ denote any $\EnDeeLambda$-graph on an odd number of vertices, and,  $\HardInstance$ denote the hard instance on $t$ vertices, as described by \citet{buss1999linear}, where the refutal certificate is of degree $\BigOmega{t}$.


\begin{enumerate}
	\item First, we show (via Lemma \ref{lemma:partition}) that we can partition the vertices of the graph $\Graph$ into two disjoint sets $A$ and $B$, as shown in Figure \ref{subfig:partitionA}. The partition has the property that for each vertex $v \in V$, has roughly $\epsilon d$ neighbours inside $A$ i.e. $|\Neighbourhood{E}{v} \cap A| \approx \epsilon d$, where $\epsilon$ is a small enough constant. Given this partitioning, we define consider the subgraph $G_A = (A, E_A)$ where the we only include edges with both endpoints in $A$ (see Figure \ref{subfig:partitionB}).
	\item Secondly, we find a subdivision $\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}$ of $H$, where for each $e \in \Edges{H}$, we have $\sigma(e) = \PathSize$ for some $l = \lceil 1/2\log_{D}n\rceil$ and $\PathSize$ is an odd integer (can be expressed as $\PathSize = 2k+1$ for some $k \in \Naturals$. We show (via Lemma \ref{lemma:top-embedding}) that $\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}$ is a subgraph of $G_A$ defined above.
	
%	\item Successfully executing the above steps guarantees that $\HardInstance$ exists inside of $\Graph$ as a topological minor. But as described earlier, this does not suffice in showing that $\PerfectMatching{\Graph}$ is also hard to refute. Let $\Embedding{\HardInstance}$ denote the vertices that form the topological embedding of $\HardInstance$ in $\Graph$. We want to show that the induced subgraph $\Graph[\Vertices{\Graph} \setminus \Embedding{\HardInstance}]$ contains a perfect matching. 
	\item We show (via Lemma \ref{lemma:perfect-matching}) that the subgraph of $G$ not participating in the topological embedding above, has a perfect matching $M$. For all $e \in M$, we set $x_e = 1$ and for all $e \notin \Edges{\Embedding{\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}}}$ but not in $M$, set $x_e = 0$. These assignments imply that the formula for refuting $\PerfectMatching{G}$ can be partially filled up, and we are left with the task of refuting a restricted formula. Refuting this restricted formula is identical to finding a refutation in the original hard instance, and thus the proof complexity for refuting perfect matching for $G$ is $\BigOmega{t}$ where $t$ is the number of vertices in the hard instance $H$. We show that $t = \BigOmega{n\log n}$.
\end{enumerate}

%Figure \ref{fig:partition} pictorially describes Lemma \ref{lemma:partition}.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:partition}Given a $\EnDeeLambda$ graph $\Graph = (V, E)$, there exists a small constant $\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and a partition of $V$ into disjoint sets $A$ and $B$, such that, we have for every $v \in V$, $|\Neighbourhood{\EdgesShort}{v} \cap A| \leq 2\epsilon d$.
%where $\delta \in (0,1)$ such that $\delta d \leq 1/4$.	
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}We prove the existence of such a partition $A \cup B = V$ using the probabilistic method.
For each $v \in \Vertices{\Graph}$, we toss an independent coin $X_i$ with bias $\epsilon$.
If $X_i = 1$, then we include $v$ in $A$, else we put $v$ in $B$.
Thus, $\vec{X} \Def (X_1, \dots, X_n) \in \bit^n$ is a random variable that describes how we partition $\Vertices{G}$ into sets $A$ and $B$.
For any $v \in V$, let $Y_v = |\Neighbourhood{\EdgesShort}{v} \cap A| = \sum_{e \in \Neighbourhood{E}{v}} \Indicator{e \in A}$ denote the random variable that counts how many neighbours of $a$ are also in $A$.\\
For any $v \in V$, let $E_v = \Indicator{|Y_v - d\epsilon | \geq \sqrt{d/2\log 2/\delta}}$ denote the bad event that $Y_v$ is very far from $\epsilon d$.
As $\Graph$ is $d$-regular, $\Mean{\vec{X}}{Y_v} = \epsilon d$, and that the dependency graph of events $\{ E_v \}_{v \in V}$ has max-degree at most $d$.
By Chernoff-Hoeffding, for any $v \in V$, we have $\PProb{E_v}{\vec{X}} \leq \delta$.
Finally, by setting $\delta$ small enough, such that $\delta d \leq 1/4$, we can invoke the Lov\`asz Local Lemma (Lemma \ref{lemma:lll}) to get $\PProb{\forall v \in V, \text{ } E_v = 0}{\vec{X}} > 0$.
When $E_v = 0$ for all $v \in V$, setting $\epsilon = \sqrt{2 \log(2/\delta)}$, gives us that $|Y_v - d\epsilon | \leq \sqrt{d/2}\sqrt{\log 2/\delta}	 \leq \epsilon d$.

\end{proof}

%Let $\tilde{\Graph} = A \cup B$ be the bipartite graph defined in the construction of Lemma \ref{lemma: bipartite-construct-non-block}.
%We know that this graph $(\pee, \qu)$ is non-blocking.
%Let $(a_1, \dots, a_k)$ denote an arbitrary ordering of arbitrary vertices in $A$.
%Set $E' = \emptyset$. 
%As $\tilde{\Graph}$ is non-blocking, there exists a collection of \emph{safe states} $\SafeStates$.


\subsection{Step 2: The Topological Emebedding}

Let $G=(V,E)$, be the $\EnDeeLambda$ graph given to us. 
Let $\epsilon, A$ and $B$ be as defined by Lemma \ref{lemma:partition}. 
Define $\dApproxLower \Def \dApproxExpandedLower$.
Define $E_A \Def \{ (u,v) \in E : u \in A \land v \in A\}$. 
That is $E_A$ are the edges whose endpoints are fully contained in A (orange edges in Figure \ref{subfig:partitionA}), and $G_A = (A, E_A)$. 
Define $ \na = |A|$.
Now define a bipartite graph $\BipartiteG = (V_A \cup V_A)$ such that if $(u,v) \in E_A$, then $(u,v) \in \Edges{\BipartiteG}$.
As $G$ is an $\EnDeeLambda$ graph, we have that $\BipartiteG$ is a $(\na, \dApproxLower, \lambda)$ graph.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:bipartitie-is-non-blocking}Let $G$ be the $\EnDeeLambda$ graph given to us and let $\BipartiteG$ be the bipartite graph described above. 
%Let $\epsilon$ be the small constant from Lemma \ref{lemma:partition}.
%Define $\dApproxLower = \dApproxExpandedLower$.
There exists $\epsilonL, \epsilonA  \in (0,1)$ small enough, such that if $\lambda < \epsilonL \dApproxLower$, then $\BipartiteG$ is $(\frac{\dApproxLower}{\lambda}, \epsilonA\na)$ non-blocking.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $X$ and $Y$ denote the left and right vertices of the bipartite graph $\BipartiteG$.
Define $a = \epsilonA\cdot\frac{\lambda \na}{\dApproxLower}$.
Fix $S \subseteq X$ such that $1 \leq |S| \leq 2a$.
Suppose towards a contradiction, $G_A$ is \emph{not} non-blocking.
Then by Lemma \ref{lemma:condtions-for-non-block}, for all $T \subseteq Y$, $\EdgesAccross{S, T}{E_A} \leq (2\dApproxLower/\lambda)|S|$.
Pick $T^* \subseteq Y$ such that 

\begin{equation}
\EdgesAccross{S, T^*}{E_A} \geq |S|\dApproxLower	 \label{eq:lots-edges}
\end{equation}

We know $T^*$ exists as $G_A$ is $\dApproxLower$ regular.
From the expander mixing lemma \ref{lemma:expanders-mixing-lemma},

\begin{align}
	\EdgesAccross{S, T^*}{E_A} &\leq \frac{\dApproxLower}{\na}|S||T^*| + \lambda\sqrt{|S||T^*|} \\
	&\leq \frac{\dApproxLower^2}{\na \lambda}|S|^2 + |S|\sqrt{2\lambda \dApproxLower} \label{eq:stepa}\\
	&< \frac{\dApproxLower^2}{\na \lambda}|S|^2 + |S|\dApproxLower\sqrt{2\epsilonL } \label{eq:stepb}\\
	&\leq |S|\dApproxLower\left[ \frac{\dApproxLower|S|}{\na\lambda} + \sqrt{2\epsilonL}\right] \\
	&\leq |S|\dApproxLower\left[ \frac{\epsilonA}{2} + \sqrt{2\epsilonL}\right] \label{eq:stepc}
\end{align}


For Equation \eqref{eq:stepa} We use that $\EdgesAccross{S, T^*}{E_A} \leq (2\dApproxLower/\lambda)|S|$. For Equation \eqref{eq:stepb} we use $\lambda < \epsilonL\dApproxLower$. For Equation \eqref{eq:stepc} we use $|S| \leq 2a$.
Setting $\epsilonA$ and $\epsilonL$ small enough such that  $\frac{\epsilonA}{2} + \sqrt{2\epsilonL} < 1$, we get a contradiction with Equation \eqref{eq:lots-edges}.

\end{proof}

The next step is to topologically embed hard instance $H$ into the subgraph $G_A = (A, E_A)$.
Note for every edge in $G_A$, by our construction, we will have a corresponding edge in the bipartite graph $\BipartiteG$.

\begin{lemma}[Topological Embedding]\label{lemma:top-embedding} 
Let $\epsilonA, \epsilonL \in (0,1)$ be the constants from Lemma \ref{lemma:bipartitie-is-non-blocking}.
Let $H$ be the worst case hard instance on $t = \lceil\epsilonA \frac{\na}{\log \na}\rceil$ vertices. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Define $D = \frac{\dApproxLower}{\lambda} = \frac{2\epsilon d}{\lambda}$ and $k \Def \lceil\log_D[\na]\rceil$.
Let $\{ h_1, \dots, h_t\}$ denote the vertices of $H$.
Let $\EmbeddingFunc: \Vertices{\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}} \rightarrow \Vertices{G_A}$ be the bijective mapping between the vertices of $\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}$, and the vertices of $G_A$, that defines our topological embedding.
Our first task is to find a unique $\Embedding{h} \in \Vertices{G_A}$ for each $h \in \Vertices{H}$.
Let $\{a_1, \dots, a_{t}\}$ be arbitrary set of $t$ vertices in $\Vertices{G_A}$.
We repeat the following process to obtain $\{ \Embedding{h_1}, \dots, \Embedding{h_t}\}$.
Let $X=\Vertices{G_A}$ and $Y=\Vertices{G_A}$ denote the left and right sides of the bipartite graph $\BipartiteG$ described above.


\begin{figure}
	\center
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{assets/baseCaseA.pdf }
	\caption{The figure above describes }
	\label{fig:baseA}
\end{figure}	


\begin{itemize}
	\item Define $E' = \emptyset$ to begin with.
	\item For $a_1 \in X$, ask for $D$ neighbours in $Y$. As $|E'| = 0 \leq \epsilonA \na$, and $\BipartiteG$ is $(D, \epsilonA \na)$ non-blocking, we can find $\tilde{h}_1 \in Y$ such that there is no edge in $|E'|$ is incident on $\tilde{h}_1$. We set $\Embedding{a_1} = \tilde{h}_1$ and update $E' = E'  \cup \{(a_1, \tilde{h}_1)\}$.
	\item We repeat this process for all $a \in \{a_2, \dots, a_t\}$. As $|E'| \leq t < \epsilonA\na$, for each $a_j$ we can always find a $\tilde{h}_j$ in $Y$ such that there is an edge $(a_j, \tilde{h}_j)$, and there is no other edge in $E'$ that is incident on each $\tilde{h}_j$.
\end{itemize}

Once this phase is complete, we have mapped every vertex of $H$ to a vertex in $G_A$.
The next step to show that for each $(u,v) \in \Edges{H}$, there is a vertex disjoint path of odd length $\PathSize = 2k+1$ between $\Embedding{u}$ and $\Embedding{v}$ in $G_A$.
Let $(e_1, \dots, e_m)$ be an arbitrary ordering of edges in $\Edges{H}$.
We prove the result by induction on $m$.

\subsubsection{Base Case, $m=1$}

\paragraph{Forward Phase} 

Let $e_1 = (u,v)$. Define sets $S_0 = \{\Embedding{u}\}$ and $\tilde{S}_0 = \{ \Embedding{v}\}$, and $M_0 = \emptyset$ and $M_0' = \emptyset$.
For each $z=1, \dots, k$, we will define edge sets $\{ M_j\}_{j \in [k]}$ and $ \{ M'_j\}_{j \in [k]}$, and vertex sets $\{ S_j\}_{j \in [k]}$ and $\{ S'_j\}_{j \in [k]}$ inductively as follows:

\begin{tcolorbox}
Fix $ 1 \leq z \leq k$, iteratively, let $M_z$ and $M'_z$ be the sets of $\SizeOfM{z} \Def \min\{t/(2k), \SizeOfM{z-1}D\}$ edges in $E_A$ incident to $S_{z-1}$ and $S_{z-1}'$ respectively, such that each vertex in $Y$ is incident to \emph{at most} one edge in $\cup_{i=1}^{z} (M_i \cup M'_i)$.
Figure \ref{fig:baseA} illustrates this iterative process visually.	\\
%
%
%
%. For each $x \in S_{j-1} \subseteq X$, ask for at most $D$ edges incident on $x$ in $E_A$. Let $E_j$ denote these edges. For every $e=(x,v) \in E_j$, we include $e \in M_j$, if there is no other edge in $\cup_{i=0}^{j-1} (M_i \cup M'_i)$ that is incident on $v$. Here $v$ is the endpoint in $Y$, and $x$ represents the endpoint in $X$.
%The set of endpoints of $M_j$ in $Y$ make up $S_j$.
%Analogously,  we define $M_j'$ as the set of edges incident on $S'_{j-1}$ such that, for end points $v \in Y$, there is no edge in $\cup_{i=0}^{j-1} (M_i \cup M'_i) \cup M_j$.
%$S'_{j}$ is defined analogously.

\end{tcolorbox}

Let $M = \cup_{i=1}^k (M_i \cup M'_i)$.
The reason we can always construct the sets described above sets is that $|M| \leq t < \epsilonA\na$, and as $\BipartiteG$ is $(D, \epsilonA\na)$ non-blocking, for any vertex $x \in S_j \subseteq X$, with at most $D$ neighbours in $S_{j+1} \subseteq Y$, we can always find \emph{at least} one $y \in Y$, such that $(x,y) \in E_A$ and no edge in $\cup_{i=1}^{j-1} (M_i \cup M'_i)$ is incident on $y$.
Now as $k = \log_D[\na]$, based on how we select $\SizeOfM{1}, \dots, \SizeOfM{k}$, we have that, $|S_k| = |S_k'|= \frac{t}{k}$.
By the expander mixing lemma \ref{lemma:expanders-mixing-lemma},

\begin{align}
	\EdgesAccross{S_k, S_k'}{E_A} &\geq \frac{\dApproxLower t^2}{\na k^2} - \lambda \frac{t}{k} > 0 \label{eq:greater}
\end{align}

Equation \eqref{eq:greater} comes from $\lambda \leq \epsilonL\dApproxLower$.

\paragraph{Base Case, Backwards Phase}

We add $e$ to $E'$, and consider end point $a \in S_k$.
By how we constructed $M_k$, we know there is an edge $m_k = (a,c)$ connecting $a$ to some vertex $c$ in $M_{k-1}$, such that $a$ has no other edges incident on it. We repeat this process all the way, till we get $k+1$ edges, $m_1 m_2 \dots, m_k e$.
We add all these edges to $E'$.
We repeat the same process for the other end point of $b \in S_k'$, to get edges $\tilde{m}_1, \dots, \tilde{m}_k$.
We add these edges to $E'$ as well. 
This gives is the situation depicted in Figure \ref{fig:baseB}.
Thus, we have found an odd length path of length $2k+1=\log_D \na$, connecting $\Embedding{u}$ to $\Embedding{v}$.

\paragraph{Induction Step}
	
Assume that we have found paths for $e_1, \dots, e_j$ for $j < m$.
The situation is described in Figure \ref{fig:induction}.
The set $E'$ consists of $j$ paths of size $\PathSize$. Therefore $|E'| \leq m*$

\subsection{Step 3: Finding A Perfect Matching In The Remainder Of The Graph}

%Lemma \ref{lemma:expanders-minimal-matching} is from \citep[Theorem 4.3]{krivelevich2006pseudo}, that says the pseudorandom graphs on an even number of vertices have perfect matchings.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:expanders-minimal-matching}\citep[Theorem 4.3]{krivelevich2006pseudo}
Let $\Graph$ be an $\EnDeeLambda$ graph with $\lambda \leq d - 2$	and $n$ is even. Then $\Graph$ has a perfect matching.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:perfect-matching}
Given $\EnDeeLambda$ graph $\Graph=(V,E)$, let $\Embedding{\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}}$ be the topological embedding of the hard instance $H$ from Lemma \ref{lemma:top-embedding}.
If $\lambda \leq \nicefrac{d}{C}$ for some large enough constant $C > 0$, then the sub-graph $\Graph[V \setminus \Embedding{\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}}]$ has a perfect matching.	
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\ari{Change notation}
Let $\epsilon, \delta, A$ and $B$ be as defined in Lemma \ref{lemma:partition}.
Define $\tilde{d} = 1 - (2\epsilon d)$
Let $\Embedding{\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}}$ denote the subgraph of $G$ which represents the topological embedding of $H$ from Lemma \ref{lemma:top-embedding}.
Define $\tilde{G} = \Graph[V \setminus \Embedding{\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}}]$. 
That is $\tilde{\Graph}$ is a subgraph of $\Graph$ using all vertices in $B$ and the vertices in $A$ that were not used to embed $\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}$.
As $\ExpansionFactor{\Graph} \leq \lambda$, and $\tilde{\Graph}$ is a subgraph, we have $\ExpansionFactor{\tilde{\Graph}} \leq \lambda$.
%\ari{This is super easy to show using basic linear algebra, I can explicitly prove this if you think it's needed.}
By lemma \ref{lemma:partition}, we know that the minimal degree $\MinimalDegree{\tilde{\Graph}} \geq \tilde{d}$.
Let $\dbtilde{\Graph}$ denote a subgraph of $\tilde{G}$, where for each $v \in \Vertices{\tilde{\Graph}}$ we retain exactly $\tilde{d}$ of its neighbours.
It is easy to see that $\dbtilde{\Graph}$ is a $(\tilde{n}, \tilde{d}, \lambda)$ pseudorandom graph, where $\tilde{n} = |\Vertices{\tilde{\Graph}}|$ and $n$ is even (since $|\Vertices{\Graph}|$ is odd and $|\Vertices{\Embedding{\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}}}|$ is also odd). 
As $\lambda \leq \tilde{d} - 2$, we invoke Lemma \ref{lemma:expanders-minimal-matching} to get that $\dbtilde{G}$ has a perfect matching.
As $\dbtilde{G}$ is a sub-graph of $\tilde{G}$ with the same vertex set, $\tilde{G}$ also has a perfect matching.
\ari{Set $C$ here so that this is less complex}.
\end{proof}
