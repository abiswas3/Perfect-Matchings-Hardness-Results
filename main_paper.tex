\paragraph{Notation} Sets are denoted with upper case normal font e.g., $S$. Families (or collections) of sets are denoted with upper case calligraphic purple text e.g., $\Family{S}$. 


\begin{definition}[Dependency Graphs]
	
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Lov\`asz Local Lemma]\label{lemma:lll}Let $\Dist \in \DistSet{\bit^*}$ be a discrete probability distribution.
Let $E_1,...,E_n$ be a set of events, and assume that the following hold:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\PProb{E_i}{\Dist} \leq \delta$ for some $\delta \in (0,1)$.
	\item The degree of the dependency graph given by $E_1, \dots, E_n$ is bounded by $d$
	\item $d\delta \leq \nicefrac{1}{4}$
	
Then, 

\[ \PProb{\overset{n}{ \underset{i=1}{\cap}} \hspace{0.1cm}  \overline{E_i}}{\Dist} > 0\]	
\end{enumerate}
	
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Proof Complexity Preliminaries}

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Calculus Refutations]\label{def:poly-calc-refutations}
	
\end{definition}

\subsection{Graph Theory Preliminaries}

For a graph $\Graph$, we use $\Vertices{\Graph}$ and $\Edges{\Graph}$ to denote the vertices and edges of $\Graph$. 
For any $E' \subseteq \Edges{\Graph}$ and a vertex $v \in \Vertices{\Graph}$, we use $\Neighbourhood{E'}{v} = \{ u \in \Vertices{\Graph} : (u,v) \in E' \}$ to denote the neighbourhood of $v$ with respect to $E'$, and $\degree{E'}{v}$ to denote the number of vertices adjacent to $v$ via edges in $E'$.

\begin{definition}[Subgraph]\label{def:subgraph}
A graph $G'=(V', E')$ is a subgraph of another graph $G=(V, E)$ iff (1) $V'\subseteq V$, and (2) $E'\subseteq E$ and  $(v1, v2) \in E' \implies (v1, v2) \in V')$.
	
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Sub-divisions]\label{def:subdivisions}
Given a graph $H$ and a function $\sigma: \Edges{H} \rightarrow \Naturals$, the $\sigma$-subdivision $H$, denoted by $\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}$, is the graph obtained by replacing each edge in $\Edges{H}$ with a path of length $\sigma(e)$ joining the end points of $e$ (such that all these paths are mutually vertex disjoint, except at the end points).	
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Topological Minor]\label{def:topological-minor}
A graph $H$ is a topological minor of a graph $G$ if there exists a subdivision $\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}$ that is isomorphic to \emph{any} subgraph of $G$.	
\end{definition}

Next we define pseudorandom graphs or expander graphs. 
Throughout this document, it suffices to treat $d$ as a small constant.

\begin{definition}[$\EnDeeLambda$ pseudorandom graphs]\label{def:expander-graphs}
Let $G$ be a $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, and, let $\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2, \dots, \geq \lambda_n$ denote eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of $G$.
We say $G$ is an $\EnDeeLambda$-graph if $\ExpansionFactor{\Graph} \Def \underset{{\{2, \dots, n\}}}{\max}|\lambda_i| \leq \lambda$.
\end{definition}


\begin{lemma}[Expander Mixing Lemma]\label{lemma:expanders-mixing-lemma}
	
\end{lemma}


\section{Embedding Machinery}

The following definitions are adapted from \citep{nenadov2023routing} but were originally introduced by \citet{feldman1988wide} in their work about the theory of wide sense blocking networks.

\begin{definition}[$(p, q)$-non blocking bipartite graphs \citep{nenadov2023routing}]
Given $p,q \in \Naturals$ , we say that a bipartite graph $\Graph = (A \cup B, E)$ is $(p, q)$ \emph{non-blocking}, if there exists a family $\Family{S}$ of subsets of $E$, called the \emph{safe states}, such that the following holds:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\emptyset \in \Family{S}$
	\item If $E'' \subseteq E'$ and $E' \in \Family{S}$, \emph{then}, $E'' \in \Family{S}$.
	\item Given $E' \in \Family{S}$ such that $|E'| \leq p$, and \emph{any} $v \in A$ with $\degree{E'}{v} < q$, there exists $e = (v, w) \in E \setminus E'$  such that (i) $E' \cup \Set{e} \in \SafeStates $, and (ii) $w$ is not incident to any edge in $E'$ i.e. $\forall x \in A$ we have $(x,w) \notin E'$. 
\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}

{\caption{A test figure with its caption side by side}\label{fig:test}}
{\includegraphics{assets/non-blocking-networks.pdf}}
\end{figure}

Next, we re-state a lemma by \citep[Proposition 1]{feldman1988wide} which describes the properties bipartite graphs must satisfy to be non-blocking.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:condtions-for-non-block}
Fix $a, r, s \in \Naturals$. Let $\Graph = (A \cup B, E)$ be a bipartite graph.
If for every $X \subseteq A$ of size $1 \leq |X| \leq 2a$, there are \emph{at least} $(r + s)|X|$ vertices in $B$ that are adjacent to $A$, \emph{then}, $\Graph$ is $(r, as)$-non blocking.
\end{lemma}


\section{Proof Of Main Result}

Let $\Graph$ denote a $\EnDeeLambda$-graph on an odd number of vertices, and,  $\HardInstance$ denote the hard instance, as described by \highlight{Buss et al} that is worst case hard for the corresponding proof system.


\begin{enumerate}
	\item First, we show (via Lemma \ref{lemma:partition}) that we can partition the vertices of the graph $\Graph$ into two disjoint sets $A$ and $B$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:partition}. The partition has the property that for each vertex $v \in V$, has roughly $\epsilon d$ neighbours inside $A$ i.e. $|\Neighbourhood{E}{v} \cap A| \approx \epsilon d$, where $\epsilon$ is a small enough constant like 0.1.
	\item Secondly, we find a subdivision $\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}$ of $H$, where for each $e \in \Edges{H}$, we have $\sigma(e) = \PathSize =2k+1$ for some $k = \lceil 1/2\log_{D}n\rceil$ (Note that $\PathSize$ is odd by definition). Next we show (via Lemma \ref{lemma:top-embedding}) that $\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}$ is a subgraph of $\Graph[A]$.
	
%	\item Successfully executing the above steps guarantees that $\HardInstance$ exists inside of $\Graph$ as a topological minor. But as described earlier, this does not suffice in showing that $\PerfectMatching{\Graph}$ is also hard to refute. Let $\Embedding{\HardInstance}$ denote the vertices that form the topological embedding of $\HardInstance$ in $\Graph$. We want to show that the induced subgraph $\Graph[\Vertices{\Graph} \setminus \Embedding{\HardInstance}]$ contains a perfect matching. 
	\item We show (via Lemma \ref{lemma:perfect-matching}) that $\Graph[B]$ has a perfect matching $M$. For all $e \in M$, we set $x_e = 1$ and for all $e \notin \Edges{\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}}$ but not in $M$, set $x_e = 0$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Step 1}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{assets/non-blocking-networks.pdf}
	\caption{Partition \highlight{Change this}}
	\label{fig:partition}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:partition} pictorially describes Lemma \ref{lemma:partition}.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:partition}Given a $\EnDeeLambda$ graph $\Graph = (V, E)$, there exists a small constant $\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and a partition of $V$ into disjoint sets $A$ and $B$, such that, we have for every $v \in V$, $|\Neighbourhood{\EdgesShort}{a} \cap A| \leq \epsilon d + \sqrt{\nicefrac{d}{2}\log (2/\delta)}$,
where $\delta \in (0,1)$ such that $\delta d \leq 1/4$.	
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}We prove the existence of such a partition $A \cup B = V$ using the probabilistic method.
For each $v \in \Vertices{\Graph}$, we toss an independent coin $X_i$ with bias $\epsilon$.
If $X_i = 1$, then we include $v$ in $A$, else we put $v$ in $B$.
Thus, $\vec{X} \Def (X_1, \dots, X_n) \in \bit^n$ is a random variable that describes how we partition $\Vertices{G}$ into sets $A$ and $B$.
For any $v \in V$, let $Y_v = |\Neighbourhood{\EdgesShort}{v} \cap A| = \sum_{e \in \Neighbourhood{E}{v}} \Indicator{e \in A}$ denote the random variable that counts how many neighbours of $a$ are in $A$.
%If $a \in B$, then $Y_a = 0$.
%Fix $\delta \in (0,1)$ small enough such that $\delta d \leq 1/4$.
For any $v \in V$, let $E_v = \Indicator{|Y_v -\epsilon d| \geq \sqrt{d/2\log 2/\delta}}$ denote the bad event that $Y_v$ is very far from $\epsilon d$.
As $\Graph$ is $d$-regular, $\Mean{\vec{X}}{Y_v} = \epsilon d$, and that the dependency graph of events $\{ E_v \}_{v \in V}$ has max-degree at most $d$.
By Chernoff-Hoeffding, for any $v \in V$, we have $\PProb{E_v}{\vec{X}} \leq \delta$.
Finally, by the assumption, $\delta d \leq 1/4$, we can 
invoke the Lov\`asz Local Lemma (Lemma \ref{lemma:lll}) to get $\PProb{\forall a \in A, \text{ } E_a = 0}{\vec{X}} > 0$.
\end{proof}

%Let $\tilde{\Graph} = A \cup B$ be the bipartite graph defined in the construction of Lemma \ref{lemma: bipartite-construct-non-block}.
%We know that this graph $(\pee, \qu)$ is non-blocking.
%Let $(a_1, \dots, a_k)$ denote an arbitrary ordering of arbitrary vertices in $A$.
%Set $E' = \emptyset$. 
%As $\tilde{\Graph}$ is non-blocking, there exists a collection of \emph{safe states} $\SafeStates$.


\subsection{Step 2}

Let $G=(V,E)$, be the $\EnDeeLambda$ graph given to us. 
Let $\epsilon, \delta, A$ and $B$ be as defined by Lemma \ref{lemma:partition}. 
Define $\dApproxLower \Def \dApproxExpandedLower$.
Define $E_A \Def \{ (u,v) \in E : u \in A \land v \in A\}$. 
That is $E_A$ are the edges whose endpoints are fully contained in A, and let $V_A \Def \{ v \in A: \text{$v$ is an endpoint of some $e \in E_A$}\}$ and let $ n_A \Def |V_A|$.
Now define a bipartite graph $G_A = (V_A \cup V_A)$ such that if $(u,v) \in E_A$, then $(u,v) \in \Edges{G_A}$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:bipartitie-is-non-blocking}Let $G$ be a $\EnDeeLambda$ graph. Set $D = \nicefrac{d}{\lambda}$. If $\lambda \leq \nicefrac{d}{C_1}$, then construction defined above is $(D, \alpha n)$ non-blocking for some $\alpha \in (0,1)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $X$ and $Y$ denote the left and right vertices of the bipartite graph $G_A$.
Let $a = \frac{\lambda n}{c_1d}$. Consider a subset $S \subseteq X$ of size $1 \leq |S| \leq 2a \leq \frac{\lambda n}{c_1'd}$. 
Suppose towards contradiction of Lemma \ref{lemma:condtions-for-non-block}, there exists $T \subseteq Y$ of vertices adjacent to $S$ of size $|T| \leq 2(d/\lambda)|X|$.

From Lemma \ref{lemma:partition}, we know that for any $v \in V_A$, $\Neighbourhood{E_A}{v} \geq \dApproxLower$.	
Therefore, for any $S\subseteq X$ and $T \subseteq Y$, we have 

\begin{equation}
\EdgesAccross{S, T}{E_A}	\geq |S| \dApproxLower
\end{equation}

As $G$ is an $\EnDeeLambda$ graph, we have that $G_A$ is a $(n_A, \dApproxLower, \lambda)$ graph.
By the expander mixing lemma (Lemma \ref{lemma:expanders-mixing-lemma}, 

\[ \EdgesAccross{S, T}{E_A}	\leq \frac{\dApproxLower}{n_A}|S||T| + \lambda\sqrt{|S||T|}\]

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Topological Embedding]\label{lemma:top-embedding}	
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
For each $h \in \Vertices{H}$, our first task is to define $\Embedding{h} \in \Vertices{G}$.

\end{proof}

\subsection{Step 3}

Lemma \ref{lemma:expanders-minimal-matching} is from \citep[Theorem 4.3]{krivelevich2006pseudo}, that says the pseudorandom graphs on an even number of vertices have perfect matchings.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:expanders-minimal-matching}
Let $\Graph$ be an $\EnDeeLambda$ graph with $\lambda \leq d - 2$	and $n$ is even. Then $\Graph$ has a perfect matching.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:perfect-matching}
Given $\EnDeeLambda$ graph $\Graph=(V,E)$, let $\Embedding{\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}}$ be the topological embedding of the hard instance $H$ from Lemma \ref{lemma:top-embedding}.
If $\lambda \leq \nicefrac{d}{C}$ for some large enough constant $C > 0$, then the sub-graph $\Graph[V \setminus \Embedding{\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}}]$ has a perfect matching.	
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\epsilon, \delta, A$ and $B$ be as defined in Lemma \ref{lemma:partition}.
Define $\tilde{d} = 1 - (\epsilon d + \sqrt{\nicefrac{d}{2}\log (2/\delta)})$
Let $\Embedding{\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}}$ denote the subgraph of $G$ which represents the topological embedding of $H$ from Lemma \ref{lemma:top-embedding}.
Define $\tilde{G} = \Graph[V \setminus \Embedding{\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}}]$. 
That is $\tilde{\Graph}$ is a subgraph of $\Graph$ using all vertices in $B$ and the vertices in $A$ that were not used to embed $\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}$.
As $\ExpansionFactor{\Graph} \leq \lambda$, and $\tilde{\Graph}$ is a subgraph, we have $\ExpansionFactor{\tilde{\Graph}} \leq \lambda$.
%\ari{This is super easy to show using basic linear algebra, I can explicitly prove this if you think it's needed.}
By lemma \ref{lemma:partition}, we know that the minimal degree $\MinimalDegree{\tilde{\Graph}} \geq \tilde{d}$.
Let $\dbtilde{\Graph}$ denote a subgraph of $\tilde{G}$, where for each $v \in \Vertices{\tilde{\Graph}}$ we retain exactly $\tilde{d}$ of its neighbours.
It is easy to see that $\dbtilde{\Graph}$ is a $(\tilde{n}, \tilde{d}, \lambda)$ pseudorandom graph, where $\tilde{n} = |\Vertices{\tilde{\Graph}}|$ and $n$ is even (since $|\Vertices{\Graph}|$ is odd and $|\Vertices{\Embedding{\Subdivision{H}{\sigma}}}|$ is also odd). 
As $\lambda \leq \tilde{d} - 2$, we invoke Lemma \ref{lemma:expanders-minimal-matching} to get that $\dbtilde{G}$ has a perfect matching.
As $\dbtilde{G}$ is a sub-graph of $\tilde{G}$ with the same vertex set, $\tilde{G}$ also has a perfect matching.
\ari{Set $C$ here so that this is less complex}.
\end{proof}
